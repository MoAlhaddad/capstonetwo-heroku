APi: For this Capstone I used the Adzuna Api https://developer.adzuna.com/#:~:text=Our%20API%20gives%20programmatic%20access,%C2%A9%202022%20ADZUNA%20LTD.
Which was use to collect adn retrieve  historical data, full job details, standardised job titles.

Tools: I used postman to test my routes to my api and perform get,post,put,and delete requests., as well as MongoDB to create my database and pull data from the job data i retrieved from adzuna

Frontend: I used React, antd majority for my styling and format of my project as well as Redux which was used a data store for my interface or UI
I used Axios as well which is a promised based HTTP client to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations
The other resources I used consists of  react-router-dom as well as toastify

Backend:On the backend of my application i was able to use bcrypt and jsonwebtoken to help implement the user authentication of the project as well as Mongoose for my database of jobs

Project Overview: This Capstone is a MernStack application which is a spin off of the jobly Project requested by my mentor that implements complex user authentication,
search filtering, and allows the user to create and account log in search up secure job data as well save the job for future reference
